# Cosmos DB 101

In this section, we will introduce CosmosDB to you, as well as key principles that you
will need to know while working with CosmosDB.

## [What is Cosmos DB?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL and relational database for modern app development.
Azure Cosmos DB offers single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guarantee speed at any scale.

### [Cosmos DB API Choice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/choose-api)

Cosmos DB allows you to use different databases APIs while utilising the powerful serverless model of Cosmos.

Cosmos DB supports the following DB APIs:
- MongoDB;
- Cassandra;
- Gremlin;
- Table;
- NoSQL (Native);

:::info
Native API tends to be faster, so if Database response time is critical for you, you may want to consider
using Native NoSQL API
:::

## NoSQL Database modeling 101

In this course we will use native Cosmos DB NoSQL API, therefore we recommend you to read the following articles:

- [Model document data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/modeling-data)
- [Modeling and partitioning - real-world example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/model-partition-example)
