# What is a Container?

> "A standard package of software - known as a container - bundles an application’s code together with the related configuration files and libraries, and with the dependencies required for the app to run. This allows developers and IT pros to deploy applications seamlessly across environments." - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-container)

> "Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. Containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop." - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers)

> "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another." - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)
