# Introdusing to Azure Functions

If you are a backend or full-stack web developer, most likely, creating any new software product for you starts with creating a web server that will track certain events and respond to them accordingly. This is a traditional approach for managing server-side logic: to use a dedicated server that runs continuously and handles all incoming requests. This server can be hosted on-premises or in the cloud, and can be managed by the application developer or a third-party service provider. And although such an approach has its quite strong advantages, such as full control over hardware resources, data security of the company, and independence from internet connection, more and more companies (40% according to O'Reilly survey in 2020) prefer serverless technologies in their activities. Azure is one of the largest and fastest-growing players in this market. So what are Azure Functions and what are their advantages over traditional server-based development? According to official documentation:
> *Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.*

Let's unpack this definition and try to decode what it's talking about:
1. This technology, as evident from its name, allows the developer to focus on writing the business logic of the software, leaving all (or at least most) of the infrastructure issues to the service itself.
2. The second point logically follows from the first - scaling a serverless application also ceases to be a problem, since the service takes care of it.
3. This approach allows the company to save resources - instead of a fixed fee for server maintenance and additional hardware expences, it only pays for the resources that are actually used.
4. There is also another fairly obvious advantage - global access to the project and its data for all employees at any time from any location.

Among the downsides of the serverless approach we can emphasize such: 
1. Limited control. Developers have limited control over the server environment, which can make it difficult to optimize the server for their specific needs.
2. Security issues. the use of third-party providers can introduce additional security and reliability concerns.
3. Portability. Since the application logic is tightly coupled with the serverless provider, it can be difficult to migrate the application to a different provider or to an on-premises environment.

In conclusion, the choice between server and serverless approaches depends on the specific needs of the application. The server approach provides more control and flexibility, but can be complex and expensive to manage. The serverless approach provides simplicity and scalability, but can have limited control and portability. Ultimately, developers should evaluate both approaches and choose the one that best fits their needs.
