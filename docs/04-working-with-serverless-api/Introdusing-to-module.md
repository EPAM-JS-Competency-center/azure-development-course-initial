# Introdusing to module

## Goal

The goal of this section is to give you a solid knowleges about Serverless architecture and how to develop and manage a Serverless API using Microsoft Azure Function App and App Config. Specifically, we will:

- Understand the general concept of Serverless and its benefits
- Explore Azure Function App and its features, using function-core-tools and Serverless framework
- Learn how to manage Function App configuration using Azure App Config

## Topics

The following topics will be covered in this section:

- **Function App:** We will explore Azure Function App, a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. We will discuss its features and how it works.
- **Using function-core-tools for local development and testing:** We will learn how to use function-core-tools, a command-line interface tool, to develop and test our Azure Function App locally.
- **What is Serverless framework?** We will discuss the general concept of Serverless architecture and its benefits.
- **Serverless framework as an alternative to function-core-tools:** We will explore the Serverless framework, which is an open-source tool for building Serverless applications. We will compare it with function-core-tools and discuss its pros and cons.
- **Using App Config to manage Function App configuration:** We will learn how to use Azure App Config, a centralized configuration store, to manage the configuration of our Azure Function App.
- **API Management:** We will discuss how to use Azure API Management to expose, secure, and manage our Serverless API.
- **Other important features:** We will cover other important features of Azure Function App, such as policies, cache, monitoring, etc.
