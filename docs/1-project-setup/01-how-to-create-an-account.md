# How to create an Azure account

:::info
Be aware that one day you may receive an email with a request to upgrade your plan, as long as you are using
services that have a [free tier for 12 months ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/#12-months-free)you can safely use the Azure subscription without charges.
Though the program is using only such services, it is better to destroy your resources when you don't need them,
because Azure has very inconvenient free tier, e.g. a service bus is free only for 750 hours of usage, a year.
You can then track your free services usage at the subscription page.
